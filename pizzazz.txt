When I hear the question, "Where should we go to dinner?", out pops the immediate answer: "Pizzazz!!".
Even when it's sub-zero temps, the casual, inviting restaurant serves up all the warmth necessary. Shannon was our friendly server who brought the eggplant parmigiana dinner with no wait. Delicious!!
Pizzazz remains a popular eatery in Cleveland Heights, delighting customers since 1975. The substantial menu presents Italian fare and a variety of salads. Takeout does a hefty business, as does dine-in.
